###  Part 1: Arrays, sorting & blocks

In the supplied sort.rb file, and

for the following array, how would I...

```
random_animals = ["porpoise", "camel", "lobster", "kangaroo", "wombat", "chameleon"]


```

* Print out a plural version of each animal on a new line(ie porpoises, camels, etc)
* Return an array of the animals sorted alphabetically
* Return an array of the animals sorted reverse alphabetically
* Return an array of the animals with each individual string reversed
* Return an array of the animals sorted by word length (low to high)
* Return an array of the animals sorted alphabetically by the last character in the string

###  Part 2: Reverse methods

In the supplied sort_methods file...

* Write a method reverse_words that given a string reverses the order of the words
* Write a method reverse_each_word that given a string reverses the order of the words

```ruby
reverse_words("We are never ever ever getting back together")
=> "together back getting ever ever never are We"

reverse_each_word("We are never ever ever getting back together")
=> "eW era reven reve reve gnitteg kcab rehtegot"
```
